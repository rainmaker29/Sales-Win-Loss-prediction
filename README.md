# Sales-Win-Loss-prediction
Predictive analysis of the classical 'Sales Win/Loss' dataset

The following models have been used in this prediction :

1) Gaussian Naive Bayes
2) Linear Support Vectors Classification
3) K Neighbors Classifier


The Sales-Win-Loss dataset was cloned from 

<https://github.com/vkrit/data-science-class/blob/master/WA_Fn-UseC_-Sales-Win-Loss.csv>

Here's a sample of dataset used :

Using this data,it's predicted if a new sale will be a win or a loss.
